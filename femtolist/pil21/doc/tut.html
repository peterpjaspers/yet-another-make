<h1>A PicoLisp Tutorial</h1>

<p style="text-align: right">(c) Software Lab. Alexander Burger

<p>This document demonstrates some aspects of the PicoLisp system in detail and
example. For a general description of the PicoLisp kernel please look at the <a
href="ref.html">PicoLisp Reference</a>.

<p>This is <i>not</i> a Lisp tutorial, as it assumes some basic knowledge of
programming, Lisp, and even PicoLisp. Please read these sections before coming
back here: <a href="ref.html#intro">Introduction</a> and <a
href="ref.html#vm">The PicoLisp Machine</a>. This tutorial concentrates on the
specificities of PicoLisp, and its differences with other Lisp dialects.

<h3>Now let's start</h3>

<p>If not stated otherwise, all examples assume that PicoLisp was started from a
global installation (see <a href="ref.html#inst">Installation</a>) from the
shell prompt as

<pre>
$ pil +
:
</pre>

<p>It loads the PicoLisp base system and the debugging environment, and waits
for you to enter input lines at the interpreter prompt (<code>:</code>). You can
terminate the interpreter and return to the shell at any time, by either hitting
the <code>Ctrl-D</code> key, or by executing the function <code><a
href="refB.html#bye">(bye)</a></code>.

<p>Input editing is done via the <code>readline(3)</code> library. You will want
to configure it according to your taste via your "~/.inputrc" file. Useful value
for PicoLisp are

<pre>
set keyseq-timeout 40
set blink-matching-paren on
TAB: menu-complete
C-y: menu-complete-backward
</pre>

In addition to the above, I (preferring vi-style) do also have

<pre>
set editing-mode vi
set keymap vi-command
v: ""
</pre>

<h3>Table of content</h3>

<p>If you are new to PicoLisp, you might want to read the following sections in
the given order, as some of them assume knowledge about previous ones. Otherwise
just jump anywhere you are interested in.

</ul>

<p><hr>
<h2><a id="brw">Browsing</a></h2>

<p>PicoLisp provides some functionality for inspecting pieces of data and code
within the running system.

<h3>Basic tools</h3>

The really basic tools are of course available and their name alone is enough
to know:
<code><a href="refP.html#print">print</a></code>,
<code><a href="refS.html#size">size</a></code>
...

<p>But you will appreciate some more powerful tools like:
<p><ul><li><code><a href="refM.html#match">match</a></code>, a predicate which
    compares S-expressions with bindable wildcards when matching,</li>
</ul>

<h3>Inspect a symbol with <i>show</i></h3>

<p>The most commonly used tool is probably the <code><a
href="refS.html#show">show</a></code> function. It takes a symbolic argument,
and shows the symbol's name (if any), followed by its value, and then the
contents of the property list on the following lines (assignment of such things
to a symbol can be done with <code><a href="refS.html#set">set</a></code>,
<code><a href="refS.html#setq">setq</a></code>, and <code><a
href="refP.html#put">put</a></code>).

<pre>
: (setq A '(This is the value))  # Set the value of 'A'
-> (This is the value)
: (put 'A 'key1 'val1)           # Store property 'key1'
-> val1
: (put 'A 'key2 'val2)           # and 'key2'
-> val2
: (show 'A)                      # Now 'show' the symbol 'A'
A (This is the value)
   key2 val2
   key1 val1
-> A
</pre>

<p><code>show</code> accepts an arbitrary number of arguments which are
processed according to the rules of <code><a
href="refG.html#get">get</a></code>, resulting in a symbol which is showed then.

<pre>
: (put 'B 'a 'A)        # Put 'A' under the 'a'-property of 'B'
-> A
: (setq Lst '(A B C))   # Create a list with 'B' as second argument
-> (A B C)
: (show Lst 2 'a)       # Show the property 'a of the 2nd element of 'Lst'
A (This is the value)   # (which is 'A' again)
   key2 val2
   key1 val1
-> A
</pre>

<h3>Inspect and edit symbols in-memory</h3>

<p>If you pass one or more symbols as a list to <code><a
href="refV.html#vi">vi</a></code>, they are written to a temporary file in a
format similar to <code>show</code>, and <code>Vip</code> is started with that
file.

<pre>
: (vi '(A B))
</pre>

<p>The <code>Vip</code> window will look like

<pre>
A (This is the value)
key1 val1
key2 val2

(=======)

B NIL
a A  # (This is the value)

(=======)
</pre>

<p>A convenient shortcut is the non-evaluating version <code>v</code> of
<code>vi</code>. An equivalent call to the above is:

<pre>
(v A B)
</pre>

<p>Now you can modify values or properties. You should not touch the
parenthesized hyphens, as they serve as delimiters. If you position the cursor
on the first character of a symbol name and type '<code>K</code>' ("Keyword
lookup"), the editor will be restarted with that symbol added to the editor
window. '<code>Q</code>' (for "Quit") will bring you back to the previous view.

<p>If you exit Vip with e.g. ":x", any changes you made in your editing session
will be communicated back to the REPL.

<p>In-memory editing is also very useful to browse in a database. You can follow
the links between objects with '<code>K</code>', and even - e.g. for low-level
repairs - modify the data (but only if you are really sure about what you are
doing, and don't forget to <code><a href="refC.html#commit">commit</a></code>
when you are done).

<h3>Built-in pretty print with <i>pp</i></h3>

<p>The <i>pretty-print</i> function <code><a href="refP.html#pp">pp</a></code>
takes a symbol that has a function defined (or two symbols that specify message
and class for a method definition), and displays that definition in a formatted
and indented way.

<pre>
: (pp 'pretty)
(de pretty (X N)
   (setq N (abs (space (or N 0))))
   (while (and (pair X) (== 'quote (car X)))
      (prin "'")
      (pop 'X) )
   (cond
      ...
      (T (prtty0 X N)) ) )
-> pretty
</pre>

<p>The style is the same as we use in source files:

<ul>

<li>The indentation level is three spaces

<li>If a list is too long (to be precise: if its <code><a
href="refS.html#size">size</a></code> is greater than 12), pretty-print the CAR
on the current line, and each element of the CDR recursively on its own line.

<li>A closing parenthesis a preceded by a space if the corresponding open
parenthesis is not on the same line

</ul>

<h3>Inspect elements one by one with <i>more</i></h3>

<p><code><a href="refM.html#more">more</a></code> is a simple tool that displays
the elements of a list one by one. It stops after each element and waits for
input. If you just hit ENTER, <code>more</code> continues with the next element,
otherwise (usually I type a dot (<code>.</code>) followed by ENTER) it
terminates.

<pre>
: (more (1 2 3 4 5 6))
1                          # Hit ENTER
2   .                      # Hit '.' and ENTER
-> T                       # stopped
</pre>

<p>Optionally <code>more</code> takes a function as a second argument and
applies that function to each element (instead of the default <code><a
href="refP.html#print">print</a></code>). Here, often <code>show</code> or
<code>pp</code> (see below) is used.

<pre>
: (more '(A B))            # Step through 'A' and 'B'
A
B
-> NIL
: (more '(A B) show)       # Step through 'A' and 'B' with 'show'
A (This is the value)      # showing 'A'
   key2 val2
   key1 val1
                           # Hit ENTER
B NIL                      # showing 'B'
   a A
-> NIL
</pre>

<h3>Search through available symbols with <i>what</i></h3>

<p>The <code><a href="refW.html#what">what</a></code> function returns a list of
all internal symbols in the system which match a given pattern (with
'<code>@</code>' wildcard characters).

<pre>
: (what "prin@")
-> (prin print prinl print> printsp println)
</pre>

<h3>Search through values or properties of symbols with <i>who</i></h3>

<p>The function <code><a href="refW.html#who">who</a></code> returns <i>"who
contains that"</i>, i.e. a list of symbols that contain a given argument
somewhere in their value or property list.

<pre>
: (who 'print)
-> (query _pretty spPrt prtty1 prtty2 prtty3 pretty ("syms>" . "+Buffer")
msg more show view (print> . +Date) rules select (print> . +relation) pico)
</pre>

<p>A dotted pair indicates either a method definition or a property entry. So
<code>(print> . +relation)</code> denotes the <code>print&gt;</code> method of
the <code><a href="refR.html#+relation">+relation</a></code> class.

<p><code>who</code> can be conveniently combined with <code>more</code> and
<code>pp</code>:

<pre>
: (more (who 'print) pp)
(de query ("Q" "Dbg")  # Pretty-print these functions one by one
   (use "R"
      (loop
         (NIL (prove "Q" "Dbg"))
         (T (=T (setq "R" @)) T)
         (for X "R"
            (space)
            (print (car X))
            (print '=)
            (print (cdr X))
            (flush) )
         (T (line)) ) ) )

(de pretty (X N)
   ...
</pre>

<p>The argument to <code>who</code> may also be a pattern list (see <code><a
href="refM.html#match">match</a></code>):

<pre>
: (who '(print @ (less (val @))))
-> (show)

: (more (who '(% @ 7)) pp)
(de day (Dat Lst)
   (when Dat
      (get
         (or Lst *DayFmt)
         (inc (% (inc Dat) 7)) ) ) )

(de _week (Dat)
   (/ (- Dat (% (inc Dat) 7)) 7) )
</pre>

<h3>Find what classes can accept a given message with <i>can</i></h3>

<p>The function <code><a href="refC.html#can">can</a></code> returns a list
which indicates which classes <i>can</i> accept a given message. Again, this
list is suitable for iteration with <code>pp</code>:

<pre>
: (can 'del>)                                   # Which classes accept 'del>' ?
-> ((del> . +List) (del> . +Entity) (del> . +relation))

: (more (can 'del>) pp)                         # Inspect the methods with 'pp'
(dm (del> . +List) (Obj Old Val)
   (and ((&lt;> Old Val) (delete Val Old)) )

(dm (del> . +Entity) (Var Val)
   (when
      (and
         Val
         (has> (meta This Var) Val (get This Var)) )
      (let Old (get This Var)
         (rel>
            (meta This Var)
            This
            Old
            (put This Var (del> (meta This Var) This Old @)) )
         (when (asoq Var (meta This 'Aux))
            (relAux This Var Old (cdr @)) )
         (upd> This Var Old) ) ) )

(dm (del> . +relation) (Obj Old Val)
   (and ((&lt;> Old Val) Val) )
</pre>

<h3>Inspect dependencies with <i>dep</i></h3>

<p><code><a href="refD.html#dep">dep</a></code> shows the dependencies in a
class hierarchy. That is, for a given class it displays the tree of its
(super)class(es) above it, and the tree of its subclasses below it.

<p>To view the complete hierarchy of input fields, we start with the root class
<code><a href="refR.html#+relation">+relation</a></code>:

<pre>
: (dep '+relation)
+relation
   +Bag
   +Any
   +Blob
   +Link
      +Joint
   +Bool
   +Symbol
      +String
   +Number
      +Time
      +Date
-> +relation
</pre>

<p>If we are interested in <code>+Link</code>:

<pre>
: (dep '+Link)
   +relation
+Link
   +Joint
-> +Link
</pre>

<p>This says that <code>+Link</code> is a subclass of <code><a
href="refR.html#+relation">+relation</a></code>, and has a single subclass
(<code>+Joint</code>).


<p><hr>
<h2><a id="fun">Defining Functions</a></h2>

<p>Most of the time during programming is spent defining functions (or methods).
In the following we will concentrate on functions, but most will be true for
methods as well except for using <code><a href="refD.html#dm">dm</a></code>
instead of <code><a href="refD.html#de">de</a></code>.

<h3>Functions with no argument</h3>

<p>The notorious "Hello world" function must be defined:

<pre>
: (de hello ()
   (prinl "Hello world") )
-> hello
</pre>

<p>The <code>()</code> in the first line indicates a function without arguments.
The body of the function is in the second line, consisting of a single
statement. The last line is the return value of <code>de</code>, which here is
the defined symbol. From now on we will omit the return values of examples when
they are unimportant.

<p>Now you can call this function this way:

<pre>
: (hello)
Hello world
</pre>

<h3>Functions with one argument</h3>

<p>A function with an argument might be defined this way:

<pre>
: (de hello (X)
   (prinl "Hello " X) )
# hello redefined
-> hello
</pre>

<p>PicoLisp informs you that you have just redefined the function. This might be
a useful warning in case you forgot that a bound symbol with that name already
existed.

<pre>
: (hello "world")
Hello world
</pre>

<pre>
: (hello "Alex")
Hello Alex
</pre>

<h3>Preventing arguments evaluation and variable number of arguments</h3>

<p>Normally, PicoLisp evaluates the arguments before it passes them to a
function:

<pre>
: (hello (+ 1 2 3))
Hello 6
</pre>

<pre>
: (setq A 1  B 2)       # Set 'A' to 1 and 'B' to 2
-> 2
: (de foo (X Y)         # 'foo' returns the list of its arguments
   (list X Y) )
-> foo
: (foo A B)             # Now call 'foo' with 'A' and 'B'
-> (1 2)                # -> We get a list of 1 and 2, the values of 'A' and 'B'
</pre>

<p>In some cases you don't want that. For some functions (<code><a
href="refS.html#setq">setq</a></code> for example) it is better if the function
gets all arguments unevaluated, and can decide for itself what to do with them.

<p>For such cases you do not define the function with a <i>list</i> of
parameters, but give it a <i>single atomic</i> parameter instead. PicoLisp will
then bind all (unevaluated) arguments as a list to that parameter.

<pre>
: (de foo X
   (list (car X) (cadr X)) )        # 'foo' lists the first two arguments

: (foo A B)                         # Now call it again
-> (A B)                            # -> We don't get '(1 2)', but '(A B)'

: (de foo X
   (list (car X) (eval (cadr X))) ) # Now evaluate only the second argument

: (foo A B)
-> (A 2)                            # -> We get '(A 2)'
</pre>

<h3>Mixing evaluated arguments and variable number of unevaluated arguments</h3>

<p>As a logical consequence, you can combine these principles. To define a
function with 2 evaluated and an arbitrary number of unevaluated arguments:

<pre>
: (de foo (X Y . Z)     # Evaluate only the first two args
   (list X Y Z) )

: (foo A B C D E)
-> (1 2 (C D E))        # -> Get the value of 'A' and 'B' and the remaining list
</pre>

<h3>Variable number of evaluated arguments</h3>

<p>More common, in fact, is the case where you want to pass an arbitrary number
of <i>evaluated</i> arguments to a function. For that, PicoLisp recognizes the
symbol <code>@</code> as a single atomic parameter and remembers all evaluated
arguments in an internal frame. This frame can then be accessed sequentially
with the <code><a href="refA.html#args">args</a></code>, <code><a
href="refN.html#next">next</a></code>, <code><a
href="refA.html#arg">arg</a></code> and <code><a
href="refR.html#rest">rest</a></code> functions.

<pre>
: (de foo @
   (list (next) (next)) )     # Get the first two arguments

: (foo A B)
-> (1 2)
</pre>

<p>Again, this can be combined:

<pre>
: (de foo (X Y . @)
   (list X Y (next) (next)) ) # 'X' and 'Y' are fixed arguments

: (foo A B (+ 3 4) (* 3 4))
-> (1 2 7 12)                 # All arguments are evaluated
</pre>

<p>These examples are not very useful, because the advantage of a variable
number of arguments is not used. A function that prints all its evaluated
numeric arguments, each on a line followed by its squared value:

<pre>
: (de foo @
   (while (args)                    # Check if there are some args left
      (let N (next)
         (println N (* N N)) ) ) )

: (foo (+ 2 3) (- 7 1) 1234 (* 9 9))
5 25
6 36
1234 1522756
81 6561
-> 6561
</pre>

<p>This next example shows the behaviour of <code>args</code> and
<code>rest</code>:

<pre>
: (de foo @
   (while (args)
      (println (next) (args) (rest)) ) )
: (foo 1 2 3)
1 T (2 3)
2 T (3)
3 NIL NIL
</pre>

<p>Finally, it is possible to pass all these evaluated arguments to another
function, using <code><a href="refP.html#pass">pass</a></code>:

<pre>
: (de foo @
   (pass println 9 8 7)       # First print all arguments preceded by 9, 8, 7
   (pass + 9 8 7) )           # Then add all these values

: (foo (+ 2 3) (- 7 1) 1234 (* 9 9))
9 8 7 5 6 1234 81             # Printing ...
-> 1350                       # Return the result
</pre>

<h3>Anonymous functions without the <i>lambda</i> keyword</h3>

There's no distinction between code and data in PicoLisp,
<code><a href="refQ.html#quote">quote</a></code> will do what you want (see
also <a href="faq.html#lambda">this FAQ entry</a>).

<pre>
: ((quote (X) (* X X)) 9)
-> 81
</pre>

<pre>
: (setq f '((X) (* X X)))  # This is equivalent to (de f (X) (* X X))
-> ((X) (* X X))
: f
-> ((X) (* X X))
: (f 3)
-> 9
</pre>


<p><hr>
<h2><a id="dbg">Debugging</a></h2>

<p>There are two major ways to debug functions (and methods) at runtime:
<i>Tracing</i> and <i>single-stepping</i>.

<p>In this section we will use the REPL to explore the debugging facilities, but
in the <a href="#script">Scripting</a> section, you will learn how to launch
PicoLisp scripts with some selected functions debugged:

<pre>
$ pil app/file1.l -"trace 'foo" -main -"debug 'bar" app/file2.l +
</pre>

<h3>Tracing</h3>

<p><i>Tracing</i> means letting functions of interest print their name and arguments
when they are entered, and their name again and the return value when they are
exited.

<p>For demonstration, let's define the unavoidable factorial function:

<pre>
(de fact (N)
   (if (=0 N)
      1
      (* N (fact (dec N))) ) )
</pre>

<p>With <code><a href="refT.html#trace">trace</a></code> we can put it in trace
mode:

<pre>
: (trace 'fact)
-> fact
</pre>

<p>Calling <code>fact</code> now will display its execution trace.

<pre>
: (fact 3)
 fact : 3
  fact : 2
   fact : 1
    fact : 0
    fact = 1
   fact = 1
  fact = 2
 fact = 6
-> 6
</pre>

<p>As can be seen here, each level of function call will indent by an additional
space. Upon function entry, the name is separated from the arguments with a
colon (<code>:</code>), and upon function exit with an equals sign
(<code>=</code>) from the return value.

<p><code>trace</code> works by modifying the function body, so generally it
works only for functions defined as lists (lambda expressions, see <a
href="ref.html#ev">Evaluation</a>). Tracing a built-in function (SUBR) is
possible, however, when it is a function that evaluates all its arguments.

<p>So let's trace the functions <code><a href="ref_.html#=0">=0</a></code> and
<code><a href="ref_.html#*">*</a></code>:

<pre>
: (trace '=0)
-> =0
: (trace '*)
-> *
</pre>

<p>If we call <code>fact</code> again, we see the additional output:

<pre>
: (fact 3)
 fact : 3
  =0 : 3
  =0 = NIL
  fact : 2
   =0 : 2
   =0 = NIL
   fact : 1
    =0 : 1
    =0 = NIL
    fact : 0
     =0 : 0
     =0 = 0
    fact = 1
    * : 1 1
    * = 1
   fact = 1
   * : 2 1
   * = 2
  fact = 2
  * : 3 2
  * = 6
 fact = 6
-> 6
</pre>

<p>To reset a function to its untraced state, call <code><a
href="refU.html#untrace">untrace</a></code>:

<pre>
: (untrace 'fact)
-> fact
: (untrace '=0)
-> =0
: (untrace '*)
-> *
</pre>

<p>or simply use <code><a href="refM.html#mapc">mapc</a></code>:

<pre>
: (mapc untrace '(fact =0 *))
-> *
</pre>

<h3>Single-stepping</h3>

<p><i>Single-stepping</i> means to execute a function step by step, giving the
programmer an opportunity to look more closely at what is happening. The
function <code><a href="refD.html#debug">debug</a></code> inserts a breakpoint
into each top-level expression of a function. When the function is called, it
stops at each breakpoint, displays the expression it is about to execute next
(this expression is also stored into the global variable <code><a
href="ref_.html#%5E">^</a></code>) and enters a read-eval-loop. The programmer
can then

<ul>

<li>inspect the current environment by typing variable names or calling
functions

<li>execute <code>(<a href="refD.html#d">d</a>)</code> to recursively debug the
next expression (looping through subexpressions of this expression)

<li>execute <code>(<a href="refE.html#e">e</a>)</code> to evaluate the next
expression, to see what will happen without actually advancing on

<li>type ENTER (that is, enter an empty line) to leave the read-eval loop and
continue with the next expression

</ul>

<p>Thus, in the simplest case, single-stepping consists of just hitting ENTER
repeatedly to step through the function.

<p>To try it out, let's look at the <code><a
href="refS.html#stamp">stamp</a></code> system function. You may need to have a
look at

<ul>
<li><code><a href="ref_.html#=T">=T</a></code> (T test),</li>

<li><code><a href="refD.html#date">date</a></code> and <code><a
href="refT.html#time">time</a></code> (grab system date and time)

<li><code><a href="refD.html#default">default</a></code> (conditional
assignments)

</pre>

<p>Now we execute it again, but this time we want to look at what's happening
inside the second expression.

(tim$ Tim T)                           # stopped at second subexpression

-> "2004-10-29 11:40:44"               # done
</pre>

<p>The breakpoints still remain in the function body. We can see them when we
pretty-print it:

<pre>
: (pp 'stamp)
(de stamp (Dat Tim)
   (! and (=T Dat) (setq Dat (date T)))
   (! default Dat (date) Tim (time T))
   (! pack
      (! dat$ Dat "-")
      " "
      (! tim$ Tim T) ) )
-> stamp
</pre>

<p>To reset the function to its normal state, call <code><a
href="refU.html#unbug">unbug</a></code>:

<pre>
: (unbug 'stamp)
</pre>

<p>Often, you will not want to single-step a whole function. Just use
<code>v</code> (see above) to insert a single breakpoint (the exclamation mark
followed by a space) as CAR of an expression, and run your program. Execution
will then stop there as described above; you can inspect the environment and
continue execution with ENTER when you are done.

<h2><a id="funio">Functional I/O</a></h2>

<p>Input and output in PicoLisp is functional, in the sense that there are not
variables assigned to file descriptors, which need then to be passed to I/O
functions for reading, writing and closing. Instead, these functions operate on
implicit input and output channels, which are created and maintained as dynamic
environments.

<p>Standard input and standard output are the default channels. Try reading a
single expression:

<pre>
: (read)
(a b c)        # Console input
-> (a b c)
</pre>

<p>To read from a file, we redirect the input with <code><a
href="refI.html#in">in</a></code>. Note that comments and whitespace are
automatically skipped by <code>read</code>:

<pre>
: (in "@lib.l" (read))
-> (de task (Key . Prg) (nond (...
</pre>

<p>The <code><a href="refS.html#skip">skip</a></code> function can also be used
directly. To get the first non-white character in the file with <code><a
href="refC.html#char">char</a></code>:

<pre>
: (in "@lib.l" (skip "#") (char))
-> "("
</pre>

<p><code><a href="refF.html#from">from</a></code> searches through the input
stream for given patterns. Typically, this is not done with Lisp source files
(there are better ways), but for a simple example let's extract all items
immediately following <code>fact</code> in the file,

<pre>
: (in "@lib.l" (while (from "nond") (println (read))))
(Prg (del (assoc Key *Run) '*Run))
((pair "X") (or (pair (getd "X")) (expr "X")))
("Prg" (caar (idx "Var" "K")))
</pre>

<p>or the word following "(de " with <code><a
href="refT.html#till">till</a></code>:

<pre>
: (in "@lib.l" (from "(de ") (till " " T))
-> "task"
</pre>

<p> To read the contents of a whole file (or the rest of it starting from the
current position):

<pre>
: (in "f.l" (till NIL T))
-> "... file contents ..."
</pre>


<p>With <code><a href="refL.html#line">line</a></code>, a line of characters is
read, either into a single <a href="ref.html#transient-io">transient</a> symbol
(the type used by PicoLisp for strings),

<pre>
: (in "@doc/tut.html" (line T))
-> "&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://..."
</pre>

<p>or into a list of symbols (characters):

<pre>
: (in "@doc/tut.html" (line))
-> ("&lt;" "!" "D" "O" "C" "T" "Y" "P" "E" " " "H" "T" "M" "L" ...
</pre>

<p><code>line</code> is typically used to read tabular data from a file.
Additional arguments can split the line into fixed-width fields, as described in
the <code><a href="refL.html#line">reference manual</a></code>. If, however, the
data are of variable width, delimited by some special character, the <code><a
href="refS.html#split">split</a></code> function can be used to extract the
fields. A typical way to import the contents of such a file is:

<pre>
(in '("bin/utf2" "importFile.txt")              # Pipe: Convert to UTF-8
   (until (eof)                                 # Process whole file
      (let L (split (line) "\t")                # TAB-delimited data
         ...                                    # process them
</pre>

<p>Some more examples with <code><a href="refE.html#echo">echo</a></code>:

<pre>
(in "a"                                         # Copy the first 40 Bytes
   (out "b"                                     # from file "a" to file "b"
      (echo 40) ) )

(in "@doc/tut.html"                             # Show the HTTP-header
   (line)
   (echo "&lt;body>") )

(out "file.mac"                                 # Convert to Macintosh
   (in "file.txt"                               # from Unix or DOS format:
      (while (char)
         (prin
            (case @
               ("\r" NIL)                       # ignore CR
               ("\n" "\r")                      # convert LF to CR
               (T @) ) ) ) ) )                  # otherwise no change

(out "c"                                        # Merge the contents of "a"
   (in "b"                                      # and "b" into "c"
      (in "a"
         (while (read)                          # Read an item from "a",
            (println @ (in -1 (read))) ) ) ) )  # print it with an item from "b"
</pre>

<h2><a id="script">Scripting</a></h2>

<p>There are two possibilities to get the PicoLisp interpreter into doing useful
work: via command line arguments, or as a stand-alone script.

<h3>Command line arguments for the PicoLisp interpreter</h3>

<p>The command line can specify either files for execution, or arbitrary Lisp
expressions for direct evaluation (see <a href="ref.html#invoc">Invocation</a>):
if an argument starts with a hyphen, it is evaluated, otherwise it is <code><a
href="refL.html#load">load</a></code>ed as a file. A typical invocation might
look like:

<pre>
$ pil app/file1.l -main app/file2.l +
</pre>

<p>It loads the debugging environment, an application source file, calls the
main function, and then loads another application source. In a typical
development and debugging session, this line is often modified using the shell's
history mechanisms, e.g. by inserting debugging statements:

<pre>
$ pil app/file1.l -"trace 'foo" -main -"debug 'bar" app/file2.l +
</pre>

<p>Another convenience during debugging and testing is to put things into the
command line (shell history) which would otherwise have to be done each time in
the application's user interface:

<pre>
$ pil app/file1.l -main app/file2.l -go -'login "name" "password"' +
</pre>

<p>The final production release of an application usually includes a shell
script, which initializes the environment, does some bookkeeping and cleanup,
and calls the application with a proper command line. It is no problem if the
command line is long and complicated.

<p>For small utility programs, however, this is overkill. Enter full PicoLisp
scripts.

<h3>PicoLisp scripts</h3>

It is better to write
a single executable file using the mechanisms of "interpreter files". If the
first two characters in an executable file are "<code>#!</code>", the operating
system kernel will pass this file to an interpreter program whose pathname is
given in the first line (optionally followed by a single argument). This is fast
and efficient, because the overhead of a subshell is avoided.

<p>Let's assume you installed PicoLisp in the directory "/home/foo/pil21/",
and put links to the executable and the installation directory as:

<pre>
$ ln -s /home/foo/pil21 /usr/lib/picolisp
$ ln -s /usr/lib/picolisp/bin/picolisp /usr/bin
</pre>

Then a simple hello-world script might look like:

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/picolisp /usr/lib/picolisp/lib.l
(prinl "Hello world!")
(bye)
</pre>

<p>If you write this into a text file, and use <code>chmod</code> to set it to
"executable", it can be executed like any other command. Note that (because
<code>#</code> is the comment character in PicoLisp) the first line will not be
interpreted, and you can still use that file as a normal command line argument
to PicoLisp (useful during debugging).

<h3>Grab command line arguments from PicoLisp scripts</h3>

<p>The fact that a hyphen causes evaluation of command line arguments can be
used to implement command line options. The following script defines two
functions <code>a</code> and <code>f</code>, and then calls <code>(<a
href="refL.html#load">load</a> T)</code> to process the rest of the command line
(which otherwise would be ignored because of the <code>(<a
href="refB.html#bye">bye</a>)</code> statement):

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/picolisp /usr/lib/picolisp/lib.l

(de a ()
   (println '-a '-> (opt)) )

(de f ()
   (println '-f '-> (opt)) )

(load T)
(bye)
</pre>

(<code><a href="refO.html#opt">opt</a></code> retrieves the next command line
option)

<p>Calling this script (let's say we named it "testOpts") gives:

<pre>
$ ./testOpts -f abc
-f -> "abc"
$ ./testOpts -a xxx  -f yyy
-a -> "xxx"
-f -> "yyy"
</pre>

<p>We have to be aware of the fact, however, that the aggregation of arguments
like

<pre>
$ ./testOpts -axxx  -fyyy
</pre>

<p>or

<pre>
$ ./testOpts -af yyy
</pre>

<p>cannot be achieved with this simple and general mechanism of command line
processing.

<h3>Run scripts from arbitrary places on the host file system</h3>

<p>Utilities are typically used outside the context of the PicoLisp environment.
All examples above assumed that the current working directory is the PicoLisp
installation directory, which is usually all right for applications developed in
that environment. Command line file arguments like "app/file1.l" will be
properly found.

<p>To allow utilities to run in arbitrary places on the host file system, the
concept of <i>home directory substitution</i> was introduced. The interpreter
remembers internally at start-up the pathname of its first argument (usually
"lib.l"), and substitutes any leading "<code>@</code>" character in subsequent
file names with that pathname. Thus, to run the above example in some other
place, simply write:

<pre>
$ /home/foo/pil21/pil @app/file1.l -main @app/file2.l +
</pre>

<p>that is, supply a full path name to the initial command (here 'pil'), or put
it into your <code>PATH</code> variable, and prefix each file which has to be
loaded from the PicoLisp home directory with a <code>@</code> character.
"Normal" files (not prefixed by <code>@</code>) will be opened or created
relative to the current working directory as usual.

<p>Stand-alone scripts will often want to load additional modules from the
PicoLisp environment, beyond the "lib.l" we provided in the first line of the
hello-world script. Typically, at least a call to

<pre>
(load "@lib/misc.l")
</pre>

<p>(note the home directory substitution) will be included near the beginning of
the script.

<p>As a more complete example, here is a script which extracts the date, name
and size of the latest official PicoLisp release version from the download web
site, and prints it to standard output:

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/picolisp /usr/lib/picolisp/lib.l

(load "@lib/misc.l" "@lib/http.l")

(use (@Date @Name @Size)
   (when
      (match
         '(@Date ~(chop " - &lt;a href=\"") @Name "\"" "&gt;"
             @Name ~(chop "&lt;/a&gt; (") @Size )
         (client "software-lab.de" 80 "down.html"
            (from "Release Archive")
            (from "&lt;li&gt;")
            (till ",") ) )
      (prinl @Name)
      (prinl @Date " -- " @Size) ) )

(bye)
</pre>

</body>
