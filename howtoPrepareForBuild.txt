Before you can build YAM you need to get boost and googletest.
Note: at time of writing the YAM repo can only be built on Windows using Visual Studio.
It is the ambition to make it buildable (and runnable) on Windows, Linux and MacOs.

Getting boost:
Download https://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_79_0.html and unzip to directory of your choice.
Update YAM\core\boost_x64_debug.props and YAM\core\coretests\coretests.vcxproj to change references to 
boost directories to the unzip directories.

Getting googletest:
From https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/README.md :

    mkdir gtest
	cd gtest
	git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git -b release-1.12.1 
	cd googletest        # Main directory of the cloned repository.
	mkdir build          # Create a directory to hold the build output.
	cd build
	cmake ..             # Generate native build scripts for GoogleTest


If you are on Windows and have Visual Studio installed, a gtest.sln file and several .vcproj files will be 
created. You can then build them using Visual Studio.

If you are on a linux system, you should now see a Makefile in the current directory. 
Just type make to build GoogleTest. 
And then you can simply install GoogleTest if you are a system administrator.
	make
	sudo make install    # Install in /usr/local/ by default

On Mac OS X with Xcode installed, a .xcodeproj file will be generated.
