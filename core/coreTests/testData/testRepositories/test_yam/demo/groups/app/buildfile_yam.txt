// The first rule has input globs on generated files. The rules that declare these
// output (generated) files are defined in buildfiles in other directories.
// Yam requires forward declaration of output files and therefore requires these
// buildfiles to be declared (kind of included) up-front.
// Note: because a directory can contain at most 1 buildfile it suffices to
// specify the directory paths.

// Groups are more efficient than globs because globs require a query evaluation.
// This is not needed for groups as their content is known.
//
// Also groups are more convenient than globs because groups do not require
// the buildfiles that contribute to a group to be declared.
