Before you can build YAM you need to get boost and googletest.
Note: at time of writing the YAM repo can only be built on Windows using Visual Studio.
It is the ambition to make it buildable (and runnable) on Windows, Linux and MacOs.

Getting boost:
Download https://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_79_0.html and unzip to directory of your choice.
Update YAM\core\boost_x64.props to change references to boost unzip directory.

Getting googletest:
When on Windows: "cmake .." needs nmake. nmake is installed as part of Visual Studio.
So first install Visual Studio.

From https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/README.md :

    mkdir gtest
	cd gtest
	git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git -b release-1.12.1 
	cd googletest        # Main directory of the cloned repository.
	mkdir build          # Create a directory to hold the build output.
	cd build
	cmake ..             # Generate native build scripts for GoogleTest


If you are on Windows and have Visual Studio installed, a googletest-distribution.sln file will be 
created. Open de .sln file in Visual Studio and build all projects (ctrl-shift-b).

If you are on a linux system, you should now see a Makefile in the current directory. 
Just type make to build GoogleTest. 
And then you can simply install GoogleTest if you are a system administrator.
	make
	sudo make install    # Install in /usr/local/ by default

On Mac OS X with Xcode installed, a .xcodeproj file will be generated.
