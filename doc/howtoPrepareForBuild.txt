Before you can build YAM you need to get boost and googletest.
Note: at time of writing the YAM repo can only be built on Windows using Visual Studio.

1- Install git for use in cmd shell
   Download Git-2.48.1-64-bit installer from https://git-scm.com/downloads/win
   and run it.

2- Create directories yam and yam\github
   All stuff needed for yam will be in this directory.
   This allows dependencies to boost and gtest to be referenced with relative
   paths.

3- Clone yam repository
   - cd yam\github
   - git clone https://github.com/peterpjaspers/yet-another-make.git main
     This creates directory yam\GitHub\main which contains the main (master)
     branch of the git yam repo.

4- Install Visual Studio Community 2022 from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/
   Take care to install at least the package for C++ development.

6- Get boost
   - Download the boost installer 1.79.0 from https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/
   - Run the installer and install to the yam directory.
     This results in directory yam\boost_1_79_0.

7- Get googletest
   - You need cmake. If this is not on your system:
     Download the Windows x64 cmake installer from https://cmake.org/download/
     and run it.
   - Clone googletest git repo
        cd yam\github
        git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git -b release-1.12.1 
     This creates directory yam\github\googletest
   - Generate VS2022 .vcxproj and.sln files
     (From https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/README.md):
        cd yam\github\googletest
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake ..
   - Open yam\github\googletest\build\googletest\gtest.sln in VS2022 and build 
     the solution for Debug and Release x64 configurations. Static libs will be written
     to directories yam\github\gtest\googletest\build\lib\Debug and 
     yam\github\gtest\googletest\build\lib\Release.

8- Download 64-bit Windows x64 installer for 7z from  https://www.7-zip.org/download.html
   Run installer install in C:\Program Files\7-Zip\

9- Build yam
   - Open yam\github\main\yam.sln in VS 2022
   - Build the solution (ctrl-shift-b)
