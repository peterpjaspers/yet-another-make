Before you can build YAM you need to get boost and googletest.
Note: at time of writing the YAM repo can only be built on Windows using Visual Studio.

1- Install git for use in cmd shell
   Download Git-2.48.1-64-bit installer from https://git-scm.com/downloads/win
   and run it.

2- Create directories yam and yam\github
   All stuff needed for yam will be in this directory.
   This allows dependencies to boost and gtest to be referenced with relative
   paths.

3- Install Visual Studio Community 2022
   From https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/
   - Take care to install at least the package for C++ development.
   - Open VS 2022 and clone repository from https://github.com/peterpjaspers/yet-another-make.git
     into the yam\GitHub directory. This will create directory yam\GitHub\main which contains
     the main (master) branch of the git yam repo.

4- Get boost
   - Download the boost installer 1.79.0 from https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/
   - Run the installer and install to the yam directory.
     This results in directory yam\boost_1_79_0.

5- Get googletest
   - You need cmake. If this is not on your system:
     Download the Windows x64 cmake installer from https://cmake.org/download/
     and run it.
   - Clone googletest git repo
        cd yam
        mkdir gtest
        cd gtest
        git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git -b release-1.12.1 
   - Generate VS2022 .vcxproj and.sln files
     (From https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/README.md):
        cd googletest
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake ..
   - Open yam\github\gtest\googletest\build\googletest\gtest.sln in VS2022 and build 
     the solution for Debug and Release x64 configurations. Static libs will be written
     to directories yam\github\gtest\googletest\build\lib\Debug and 
     yam\github\gtest\googletest\build\lib\Release.

6- Build yam
   - Open yam\GitHub\main\yam.sln
   - Build the solution
