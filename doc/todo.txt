Todo for R 0.1.0
Bugs
- create test_yam dir and build it. Then rename dir project to project1 and run yam.
  Expected result: build passes, actual result: build fails because stale output
  files in dir project1.
  Beta build: yamServer was observing the repository when the renaming  took place. 
  Yam detects that project was renamed to project1. It can then rename the mirror
  of project to project1. However, renaming a node is not trivial.
  Alpha build: Yam will remove mirror of project and add mirror of
  project1 and will see no relation between these 2 events. Perhaps heuristics
  can be used to detect that project1 is a rename of project. In that case
  Yam can delete the stale output files. Should only be deleted on user confirm.
  Try to solve this or accept and explain in the manual?

Features
- multi-repo build: clone repos in subdirs of the yam root dir.
  Remove relation with .git directory in class DotYamDirectory?
- buildscope: current implementation only searches for the producers of dirty 
  generated file nodes. Could also search all dirty nodes to allow for example:
      yam *.cpp // hash file nodes
      yam buildfile_yam.txt // compile buildfile, or execute all commands 
                            // produced by buildfile
      yam submodules/<objects> // execute group

- integrate Phil's file access monitor
    - how to deal with input dependencies on non-existing source files
      Note: these source file nodes are NOT in state Deleted. How to GC these
      nodes when no longer refd => GC sweep over context to remove node with
      use_count 1. delete when not observed
    - how to deal with directory enumeration (file paths containing *)
    - //? (extended length) paths (now //? is remove, i.e. convert to normal length path)
    - After execution (hashing) of detected input and output files: check whether
      last write times match the ones provided by access monitor. If not equal
      then fail the execution and invalidate the execution hash to force command 
      to re-execute at next build. 

- fileaspect configuration
      - hash = last-write-time (e.g. for generated files in cmd executionhash)
      - import lib hash = hash of exported symbols (hash i/f of dll)
- unit-test support
- packaging support (group containing files-to-be-packaged, buildfile that generates packaging rule)
- response files
- xxhash stream
- build yam with yam
- deal with dependencies on gtest, boost, xxhash
  xxhash requires license to be part of binary redistribution.
- license
- C++20 modules support
  Allow commands to generate buildfiles.
  while (dirty buildfiles found) build();
  Buildfile that generates two rules:
      - a rule to parse each C++ file for module imports/exports and store these
       imports/exports in file.cpp.modules and in group <modules>
      - <modules> |> generateCompileRules %f %o |> buildfile_yam_cppmodules.txt
       Where generatedCompileRules creates the compilation rules taking the 
       module dependency graph into account.
  yam recognizes this rule (by its output file name) as a rule-producing rule,
  parses the resulting buildfile_yam_cppmodules.txt into compilation CommandNodes 
  and executes the commands.

Out-of-scope:
- distributed build
- build cache (read MS buildXL section on caching!)
- btree/page caching
- tup-compatible syntax
- variants (tup variants, MR build configurations)
  Requires syntax for variables
- buildstate export to e.g. Jason or XML or to some graph format.
  Export verbose or compact.
  Verbose: references to nodes are path names
  Compact: each node has a unique id, references to nodes are ids.

Ideas:
- replace node name (a path) by a unique id (32 or 64 bit)
  This reduces storage space requirements for non-file nodes.
  File nodes have an additional propery filePath [std::filesystem::path]
  Problems: how to reuse CommandNodes when a buildfile was changed?
  Now: if node name (path of first output file) matches: reuse
  Then: if node inputs, outputs and command match: reuse
- yam creates group hierachy of output files. Hierarchy
  mirrors the directory tree in which outputs are stored.
  E.g. outputs are a/O1, a/O2, a/b/c/O3. 
  Output groups <a> contains O1, O2 and <b>, <b> contains <c>, 
  <c> contains O3.
  yam <b>/** builds all outputs in <b> recursively. Same would happen
  for yam b/**. 
  <b>/** is kind of O(N) where N is nr of elements below <b>
  b/** is O(N), where N is nr of dirty generated file nodes in buildstate.
  yam <b>/<c>/O3 is O(N) where N is nr of elements in <b> and in <c>



More:
- implement DotIgnoreNode
- investigate use of std::filesystem::path.string() and initializing paths
  from a std::string. Shouldn't we use wstring?
